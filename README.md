# Hi there :wave:, 

- :Calculator:

#### Yo! I made a simple Desktop calculator using Python Tkinter to help you solve basic mathematical problems.
### You don't have Python installed on your PC? No worries, I already converted it to Standalone executable in order to have the project saved on desktop as a software without you having to run the code anymore.
### All you need to do is run the .exe file i.e calculator.exe and have it run on your desktop!
